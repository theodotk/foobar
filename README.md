# foobar

My solutions to Google foobar challenge. I didn't put here the levels 1 and 2, as they are trivial.

People say it used to be a secret Google hiring mechanism, but I guess that now with all the LeetCode and HackerRank exercises it doesn't work anymore. I didn't know these sites exised though when I was passing this challenge, so it was more fun for me.

It was A. who inspired me to do it, so I dedicate my passing this challenge to her. Special thanks to Sasha for the referal.
