# Problem 4.1

Distract the Trainers
=====================

The time for the mass escape has come, and you need to distract the bunny trainers so that the workers can make it out! Unfortunately for you, they're watching the bunnies closely. Fortunately, this means they haven't realized yet that the space station is about to explode due to the destruction of the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. Also fortunately, all that time you spent working as first a minion and then a henchman means that you know the trainers are fond of bananas. And gambling. And thumb wrestling.

The bunny trainers, being bored, readily accept your suggestion to play the Banana Games.

You will set up simultaneous thumb wrestling matches. In each match, two trainers will pair off to thumb wrestle. The trainer with fewer bananas will bet all their bananas, and the other trainer will match the bet. The winner will receive all of the bet bananas. You don't pair off trainers with the same number of bananas (you will see why, shortly). You know enough trainer psychology to know that the one who has more bananas always gets over-confident and loses. Once a match begins, the pair of trainers will continue to thumb wrestle and exchange bananas, until both of them have the same number of bananas. Once that happens, both of them will lose interest and go back to supervising the bunny workers, and you don't want THAT to happen!

For example, if the two trainers that were paired started with 3 and 5 bananas, after the first round of thumb wrestling they will have 6 and 2 (the one with 3 bananas wins and gets 3 bananas from the loser). After the second round, they will have 4 and 4 (the one with 6 bananas loses 2 bananas). At that point they stop and get back to training bunnies.

How is all this useful to distract the bunny trainers? Notice that if the trainers had started with 1 and 4 bananas, then they keep thumb wrestling! 1, 4 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 1, 4 and so on.

Now your plan is clear. You must pair up the trainers in such a way that the maximum number of trainers go into an infinite thumb wrestling loop!

Write a function solution(banana_list) which, given a list of positive integers depicting the amount of bananas the each trainer starts with, returns the fewest possible number of bunny trainers that will be left to watch the workers. Element i of the list will be the number of bananas that trainer i (counting from 0) starts with.

The number of trainers will be at least 1 and not more than 100, and the number of bananas each trainer starts with will be a positive integer no more than 1073741823 (i.e. 2^30 -1). Some of them stockpile a LOT of bananas.

Escape Pods
===========

You've blown up the LAMBCHOP doomsday device and relieved the bunnies of their work duries -- and now you need to escape from the space station as quickly and as orderly as possible! The bunnies have all gathered in various locations throughout the station, and need to make their way towards the seemingly endless amount of escape pods positioned in other parts of the station. You need to get the numerous bunnies through the various rooms to the escape pods. Unfortunately, the corridors between the rooms can only fit so many bunnies at a time. What's more, many of the corridors were resized to accommodate the LAMBCHOP, so they vary in how many bunnies can move through them at a time. 

Given the starting room numbers of the groups of bunnies, the room numbers of the escape pods, and how many bunnies can fit through at a time in each direction of every corridor in between, figure out how many bunnies can safely make it to the escape pods at a time at peak.

Write a function solution(entrances, exits, path) that takes an array of integers denoting where the groups of gathered bunnies are, an array of integers denoting where the escape pods are located, and an array of an array of integers of the corridors, returning the total number of bunnies that can get through at each time step as an int. The entrances and exits are disjoint and thus will never overlap. The path element `path[A][B] = C` describes that the corridor going from A to B can fit C bunnies at each time step.  There are at most 50 rooms connected by the corridors and at most 2000000 bunnies that will fit at a time.

For example, if you have:

`entrances = [0, 1]`

`exits = [4, 5]`

`path = [`

`  [0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0],  # Room 0: Bunnies`

`  [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0],  # Room 1: Bunnies`

`  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],  # Room 2: Intermediate room`

`  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6],  # Room 3: Intermediate room`

`  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 4: Escape pods`

`  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 5: Escape pods`

`]`

Then in each time step, the following might happen:

+ 0 sends 4/4 bunnies to 2 and 6/6 bunnies to 3
+ 1 sends 4/5 bunnies to 2 and 2/2 bunnies to 3
+ 2 sends 4/4 bunnies to 4 and 4/4 bunnies to 5
+ 3 sends 4/6 bunnies to 4 and 4/6 bunnies to 5

So, in total, 16 bunnies could make it to the escape pods at 4 and 5 at each time step.  (Note that in this example, room 3 could have sent any variation of 8 bunnies to 4 and 5, such as 2/6 and 6/6, but the final solution remains the same.)
